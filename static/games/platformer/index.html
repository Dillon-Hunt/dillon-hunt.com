        <h1>The Task</h1>
        <p>The Purpose & Criteria of the Game.</p>
        <p class="center-70">
            The task was to create a fun and interactive game to teach a core skill to a lower primary group. 
            The task involved using the phaser library to design and produce a fun and engaging game. 
            The project spanned 9 weeks and the resulting game was awesome. 
            Below I will detail all the steps in the design process and attach a downloadable pack to recreate it for yourself, including all my assets.
        </p>

    <section class="secondary">
        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>The Stages of the Design & Thought Process.</p>
        <p>
            The key elements I wished to include were:
            <ul>
                <li>A Player</li>
                <li>A Goal or Mission</li>
                <li>A Reward</li>
                <li>An Enemy</li>
                <li>A Learning Objective</li>
                <li>Checkpoints</li>
                <li>A Possible Bonus</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>This is how I have decided to implement these elements:</p>

        <div style="padding-left: 20px; width: calc(70% + 80px); text-align: justify;">
            <h2 id="point">Story</h2>
            <p>The player is exploring the world we live in by passing through different 'countries' and visiting famous landmarks along the way. As the player progresses the game becomes increasingly harder creating stress meaning that the player will feel a greater sense of achievement when they complete the game.</p>
            
            <h2 id="point">The Player</h2>
            <p>I wanted the player to look fun and cartoon like, in the end I chose to do a purple alien as it contrasted well with the background</p>

            <h2 id="point">The Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal of the game is to reach the end of the platformer by controlling a sprite using the arrow keys. The map is slowly increasing in difficulty while collecting as many coins as possible to achieve the maximum possible score while trying not to lose any lives.</p>

            <h2 id="point">The Reward</h2>
            <p>To add some incentive to the game I chose to scatter coins with increasing value to encourage the player to explore and challenge themselves.</p>

            <h2 id="point">The Enemy</h2>
            <p>Instead of a traditional moving enemy, I chose to simply add in some challenges like spikes and tough jumps to put pressure on the player and keep them engaged with the game as it gives the sense of accomplishment and challenges them to try and beat their previous score.</p>

            <h2 id="point">The Learning Objective</h2>
            <p>This game aims to teach the lower primary group about the countries, flags and landmarks of the world through a fun and interactive platformer game. The game also helps to develop their patience and ability to cope with stress in an enjoyable and engaging environment.</p>

            <h2 id="point">Checkpoints</h2>
            <p>Checkpoints are located at the beginning of each 'Country' represented by their respective flag. They are not too far apart, meaning that if the player makes a mistake they won't need to redo too much of their work to get back to where they were. This aims to minimise the frustration factor of a regular platformer game to make it more manageable for the younger audience. The game works with a 3 life system giving the player multiple chances to reach the end but at the same time still keeping the constant challenge with the threat of falling and needing to restart.</p>

            <h2 id="point">Bonus</h2>
            <p>There are higher value coins in places harder to reach so that the player is rewarded for his/her efforts and encouraged to take risks and explore further into the game and find hidden secrets throughout it. adding to the game's replayability.</p>
        
            <h2 id="point">Audience</h2>
            <p>The target audience for this game is lower primary. The game aims to engage them with simplistic design and intuitive controls. The assets & tiles change throughout the map for a more engaging experience. The game challenges their problem-solving skills as well as teaching basic geography. The game also has some hidden features like secret powerus and jetpacks that the player will discover the more that they explore the game.</p>
