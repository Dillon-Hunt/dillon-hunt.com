# Project Idea
The idea of NewTab was to create a free web extension to allow users to have a customizable new tab page that was hard to find with similar products. The entire project is based on customizability and simplicity.

# An Add-on For Everyone
NewTab is an all in one New Tab Add-on for every Firefox user. With heaps features such as autocomplete, notes, to do list, stats customization and more. This Add-on is going to continue to be improved and updated as user feedback is received.

# Widgets
NewTab Add-on has customizable widgets including stats, notes and an app creator and many more in development ready for the next update!

# Custom Offline Backgrounds:
NewTab allows you to use one of our pre-installed backgrounds or use the image URL of any image, supporting PNG, SVG, JPG, GIF, WEBP and more.
