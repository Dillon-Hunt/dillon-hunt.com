# Idea
The social media app was designed to combine the key experience of Instagram with it's photo sharing capabilities alongside the community based structure of sites like reddit, together you would be able to set up community events, create group goals, message your friends and share photos with each other.

# Progress
The [project](https://social-media-app-fcc1f.web.app) has the fundamental aspects of a social media platform, including authentication, posting, linking and following however key features such as commenting and communities are still missing.
