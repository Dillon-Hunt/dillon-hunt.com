            <h3>Here Is A Small Overview Of Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Dillon Hunt, I am high-school student and I love programming. 
                I reside on the Sunshine Coast, Australia.
                I like to create small websites & games in my spare time to improve my skills. 
                When creating a website I usually use vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                I am a frontend programmer but I am trying to build my experience in full stack development. I enjoy collaborating with my friends to create projects that we couldn't create individually. 
            </p>
