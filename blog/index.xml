      <description>What is NewTab Pastels? NewTab Pastels is a fun minimalist &amp;amp; colorful customizable pastel themed new tab page with search bar. Inspired by the original NewTab, NewTab Pastels was designed to me a more minimal version, while still allowing for a great amount of customization and features.
Features NewTab page slowly scrolls through the rainbow on each new tab. Customize your NewTab page with the sidebars. Add custom bookmarks directly to you new tab page.</description>

      <description>Idea The social media app was designed to combine the key experience of Instagram with it&amp;rsquo;s photo sharing capabilities alongside the community based structure of sites like reddit, together you would be able to set up community events, create group goals, message your friends and share photos with each other.
Progress The project has the fundamental aspects of a social media platform, including authentication, posting, linking and following however key features such as commenting and communities are still missing.</description>

      <description>Idea The task for the platformer game was to create a fun and educational platformer for primary school aged students.
Breakdown of The Task The framework which is used for this project is Phaser.js which means this will be a web based JavaScript using canvas. Since the game is to be used in schools obviously there will be no or minimal violence and it needs to be quite easy to pick up and play.</description>

      <title>RPG Part 1 - Ideation &amp; Planning | Dillon Hunt</title>
      <link>https://dillon-hunt.com/blog/rpg-game-devlog-part-1/</link>

      <guid>https://dillon-hunt.com/blog/rpg-game-devlog-part-1/</guid>
      <description>Concept The idea for the game is to make a top down style rpg game. It is going to be built using javascript and canvas. I am not yet sure about the art style or storyline however I want it to have combat mechanics like a dungeon crawler where you equipt a weapon and need to fight enemies to progress. The game is loosely based on the Pizza Legends tutorial series by Drew Conley</description>
